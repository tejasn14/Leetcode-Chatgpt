### First Principles Thinking

The problem asks us to find two numbers in the array that sum up to a specific target value. The constraints are:

1. The array contains at least 2 and at most 10^4 elements.
2. Each element's value can range from -10^9 to 10^9.
3. Only one valid answer exists for each input.

The fundamental task is to identify two numbers in the array that add up to the given target.

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:

- Loop through each pair of numbers and check if they add up to the target. If they do, return their indices.

#### Programming/Coding Principles:

- We'll use two nested loops to iterate through each pair of numbers.
- For each pair, we'll check if they add up to the target.

#### Python Code:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\), as we use nested loops.
- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\), as we're using only a constant amount of extra space.

### Optimized Approaches:

#### Approach 1: Using a Hash Table

##### Intuition:

- Use a hash table to store elements that we have visited. For each new element, we can easily check if its complement (target - element) exists in the hash table.

##### Transition from Brute Force:

- Instead of using two nested loops, we will use a single loop and a hash table to find the answer in one pass.

##### Programming/Coding Principles:

- We'll use a hash table to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far and their respective indices.

##### Python Code:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
```

##### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: \(O(n)\), as we only loop through the array once.
- Space Complexity: \(O(n)\), for the hash table.

### Strategies and Techniques:

1. **Two Pointers**: This strategy could be used if the array was sorted. But the current problem requires maintaining the original indices, so sorting is not suitable here.
2. **Hash Table**: Extremely useful when you need quick look-up to check if an element exists or to store the mapping of elements to some value (in this case, their indices).

#### Follow-up:

Yes, the optimized approach using a hash table already achieves a time complexity that is less than \(O(n^2)\), specifically \(O(n)\).

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0)
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i], 0)
        return countS == countT
