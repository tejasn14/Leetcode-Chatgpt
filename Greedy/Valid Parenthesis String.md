### First Principles Thinking:

1. **Fundamental Truths**: 
   - The string `s` contains three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*'.
   - Parentheses must be balanced and in the correct order.
   - The asterisk '*' can serve as either a left parenthesis, a right parenthesis, or be ignored.
   
2. **Objective**: 
   - To determine whether the string `s` can be considered a valid parenthesis string.

3. **Constraints**: 
   - The length of `s` is between 1 and 100.

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:

One naive way to solve this problem is to generate all possible combinations by replacing '*' with '(', ')', or '' and then check for valid parentheses. However, this would be highly inefficient.

#### Programming/Coding Principles:

- **Raw Algorithm**: 
  - Generate all possible combinations and validate each.
  
- **Data Structures**: 
  - List to store combinations.

- **Loops**: 
  - Nested loop to generate combinations.

- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
  - Base Case: All combinations generated.
  - Edge Case: Single character strings.

#### Python Code for Brute Force Approach:

```python
# This is not recommended due to inefficiency
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(3^n)\) where \(n\) is the size of the string (for 3 choices for each '*').
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

### Optimized Approaches:

#### Intuition and Train of Thought for Optimization:

We can use two counters to keep track of the minimum and maximum number of open brackets. Whenever we encounter '(', we can increment both counters. For ')', we decrement. For '*', it can be either, so it affects the range.

#### Step-by-step Transition:

1. Start with two counters `minOpen` and `maxOpen` initialized to 0.
2. Traverse the string and update counters.
3. If at any point `maxOpen` becomes negative, return False.
4. At the end, `minOpen` should be 0 to ensure balance.

#### Programming/Coding Principles for Optimized Approach:

- **Raw Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize `minOpen` and `maxOpen` to 0.
  2. Loop through string to update counters.

- **Data Structures**: 
  - Use integer counters.

- **Loops**: 
  - Single `for` loop to traverse the string.

- **Update Criteria**: 
  - Update `minOpen` and `maxOpen` based on the character encountered.

- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
  - Base Case: Reach the end of the string.
  
#### Python Code for the Optimized Solution:

```python
def checkValidString(s):
    minOpen, maxOpen = 0, 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            minOpen += 1
            maxOpen += 1
        elif char == ')':
            minOpen = max(minOpen - 1, 0)
            maxOpen -= 1
        else:
            minOpen = max(minOpen - 1, 0)
            maxOpen += 1
            
        if maxOpen < 0:
            return False
            
    return minOpen == 0

# Test the function
print(checkValidString("()"))    # Should return True
print(checkValidString("(*)"))   # Should return True
print(checkValidString("(*))"))  # Should return True
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)

### Strategies and Techniques:

1. **Counter-based Range**: Using counters to maintain a range of possible valid values can be more efficient than generating combinations.
2. **Early Exit**: If you can determine that a solution isn't possible partway through the algorithm, exit early to save time.

These strategies can be generalized to other problems where you're trying to maintain a balance or match elements in a sequence.

            if leftMax < 0:
                return False
            if leftMin < 0:  # required because -> s = ( * ) (
                leftMin = 0
        return leftMin == 0

```
Certainly, let's dive into these two different approaches for solving the problem of checking whether a string with parenthesis and asterisks can form a balanced set of parenthesis. We'll go step-by-step, following your desired pattern.

### First Principles Thinking:
The core issue is to verify if a given string of parentheses and asterisks can form a balanced set of parentheses. A balanced set of parentheses means that for every opening parenthesis `(`, there should be a corresponding closing parenthesis `)` that matches it.

#### Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach
##### Explanation
The DP approach uses memoization to save already computed values for subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

###### Programming/Coding Principles
1. **Why Recursion & Memoization**: We can use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems. Memoization, storing the results of expensive function calls, is used here to avoid recomputation.

2. **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary `dp` to store the memoized results. The key is a tuple `(i, left)` that represents the state of the string at index `i` with `left` open parentheses.

3. **Why 'dfs' function**: It serves as our recursive function that checks the validity of the string for each subproblem and saves the result in `dp`.

4. **Base Cases and Edge Cases**: 
    - If `i` becomes equal to the length of the string, or if `left` becomes negative, then the base case triggers.
    - If the number of open brackets is zero at the end, the string is valid.

###### Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        dp = {(len(s), 0): True}

        def dfs(i, left):
            if i == len(s) or left < 0:
                return left == 0
            if (i, left) in dp:
                return dp[(i, left)]

            if s[i] == "(":
                dp[(i, left)] = dfs(i + 1, left + 1)
            elif s[i] == ")":
                dp[(i, left)] = dfs(i + 1, left - 1)
            else:
                dp[(i, left)] = (
                    dfs(i + 1, left + 1) or dfs(i + 1, left - 1) or dfs(i + 1, left)
                )
            return dp[(i, left)]

        return dfs(0, 0)
```

###### Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\)  
Space Complexity: \(O(n)\)

#### [[Greedy]] Approach
##### Explanation
This algorithm uses a greedy approach to keep track of the minimum and maximum number of open parentheses that could be valid.

###### Programming/Coding Principles
1. **Why Two Variables `leftMin` and `leftMax`**: We maintain these to represent the range of valid open parentheses at any given point.
  
2. **Why a Single Pass Loop**: This greedy approach lets us solve the problem in a single pass through the string, updating `leftMin` and `leftMax` on the fly.
  
3. **Base Cases and Edge Cases**: 
    - If `leftMax` becomes negative, return False immediately.
    - If `leftMin` becomes negative, reset it to zero.

###### Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        leftMin, leftMax = 0, 0

        for c in s:
            if c == "(":
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin + 1, leftMax + 1
            elif c == ")":
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin - 1, leftMax - 1
            else:
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin - 1, leftMax + 1
            if leftMax < 0:
                return False
            if leftMin < 0:
                leftMin = 0
        return leftMin == 0
```

###### Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)  
Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

#### Strategies and Techniques
1. **Recursion + Memoization**: Useful when subproblems are solved multiple times.
  
2. **Greedy**: Effective when solving the problem in one pass is possible, and you need a more optimized solution.

Both these approaches can be generalized to similar problems involving string manipulation, parentheses matching, and state-based problems.
