### Problem Description
Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length from that position. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must make to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given `[6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]`, you should return `2` as the minimum number of jumps to get to the end of the array.

### First Principles Thinking
The fundamental truth of this problem is that you can jump a variable number of steps from any index `i` to index `i + nums[i]`. The goal is to minimize the number of jumps you take to reach the end. From each index, you have various options to jump. The key insight is to pick the right next index that allows you to take fewer total jumps to reach the end of the array.

### Brute Force Approach
#### Explanation
A brute-force approach is to explore all possible jump combinations to get to the end of the array. You can use a recursive function to jump from each index to each of its reachable indices and keep track of the minimum jumps needed.

#### Python Code
```python
def jump_game(nums):
    if len(nums) <= 1:
        return 0
    
    def helper(index, jumps):
        if index >= len(nums) - 1:
            return jumps
        
        min_jumps = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, nums[index] + 1):
            next_index = index + i
            min_jumps = min(min_jumps, helper(next_index, jumps + 1))
        
        return min_jumps
    
    return helper(0, 0)

nums = [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]
print(jump_game(nums))
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(2^N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the array. This is because we explore each of the 2 possible decisions (jump or not jump) for each index. The space complexity is \(O(N)\) for the recursion call stack.

### Optimized Approaches
Let's move on to the optimized approaches.

### Optimized Approaches
#### First Optimization: Dynamic Programming
##### Intuition and Train of Thought
Instead of recomputing the minimum jumps from the same index multiple times, we can store the result in a memoization table. This can speed up our solution by avoiding redundant calculations.

##### Step-by-step Transition
We can use dynamic programming to store the minimum jumps required from each index. The key is to use a memo array that stores the minimum number of jumps to reach the end from each index.

##### Python Code
```python
def jump_game(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    memo = [float('inf')] * n
    memo[-1] = 0
    
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(1, nums[i] + 1):
            if i + j < n:
                memo[i] = min(memo[i], 1 + memo[i + j])
                
    return memo[0]

nums = [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]
print(jump_game(nums))
```

##### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the length of the array, and \(M\) is the maximum value in the array. The space complexity is \(O(N)\) for the memo array.

#### Second Optimization: Greedy Approach
##### Intuition and Train of Thought
We can optimize further by observing that it is always optimal to take the farthest jump that leads to the minimum number of jumps to the end. We can maintain two pointers, `current_farthest` and `current_end`, to determine when to take the next jump.

##### Step-by-step Transition
1. Start at the beginning of the array with `jumps` set to 0.
2. For each index, update the farthest index reachable from that index.
3. When you reach `current_end`, take a jump and update `current_end` to `current_farthest`.

##### Python Code
```python
def jump_game(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    jumps, current_end, current_farthest = 0, 0, 0
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        current_farthest = max(current_farthest, i + nums[i])
        if i == current_end:
            jumps += 1
            current_end = current_farthest
    
    return jumps

nums = [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]
print(jump_game(nums))
```

##### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(N)\), and the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

### Strategies and Techniques

Certainly! Let's delve deep into the structure of this Dynamic Programming-based Python code for the Jump Game II problem.

### Function Definition
```python
def jump_game(nums):
```
This line defines a function named `jump_game` that takes a list `nums` as an argument. The list contains non-negative integers representing the maximum jump length from that position.

### Initializing Variables
```python
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
```
- `n = len(nums)`: Finds the length of the input list and stores it in `n`.
- `if n <= 1: return 0`: Edge case to handle lists with 0 or 1 elements. You don't need to jump anywhere in this case, so the function returns 0.

### Setting Up Memoization
```python
    memo = [float('inf')] * n
    memo[-1] = 0
```
- `memo = [float('inf')] * n`: Initializes a list called `memo` of length `n`, filled with infinity (`float('inf')`). This list will store the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end from each index.
- `memo[-1] = 0`: Sets the last element of the memo list to 0, because you're already at the end of the array at this point.

### Main Logic: [[Dynamic Programming]]
```python
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(1, nums[i] + 1):
            if i + j < n:
                memo[i] = min(memo[i], 1 + memo[i + j])
```
- `for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1)`: Iterates through the array in reverse, starting from the second-last element to the first. This helps in making sure that we calculate memo for the later indices before the earlier ones.
- `for j in range(1, nums[i] + 1)`: For each index `i`, this nested loop goes through all the possible jumps (`j`) we can make from `i`.
- `if i + j < n`: Checks whether the jump lands within the array boundary.
- `memo[i] = min(memo[i], 1 + memo[i + j])`: Updates `memo[i]` to be the minimum number of jumps needed from index `i` to the end of the array.

### Return Statement
```python
    return memo[0]
```
Finally, `memo[0]` will contain the minimum number of jumps required to go from the first index to the last index, which is returned as the answer.

### Execution
```python
nums = [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]
print(jump_game(nums))
```
This part of the code tests the function with an example list and prints the output.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \times M)\) where \(N\) is the length of the array, and \(M\) is the maximum value in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the memoization array.

This implementation follows your First Principles Approach by identifying the fundamental requirements of the problem, building up a brute-force solution, and then optimizing it using Dynamic Programming. It also fits into your strategy of incremental improvement and complexity analysis.

                maxJump = max(maxJump, i + nums[i])
            l = r + 1
            r = maxJump
            res += 1
        return res

```
Alright, let's break down this solution for the "Jump Game II" problem using the **First Principles Approach** and the other guidelines you've provided. The code aims to determine the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array.

### First Principles:

#### What are the base truths?
1. You can jump from an index as many steps as the value at that index.
2. If you jump the maximum length possible at each step, you minimize the number of jumps required.
3. At each position, you don't just consider the max jump possible from that point but the max jump possible from any point within the range of the previous jump. This ensures you're evaluating all potential paths.

### Intuition and Approach:

1. **BFS-like approach**: The given solution can be likened to a BFS (Breadth First Search) traversal where you're looking at all possible jumps from your current range (`l` to `r`), then updating your range based on the maximum jump possible within that range.
2. **Greedy Approach**: At each "level" of the BFS traversal, the aim is to find the furthest you can reach with the next jump. This ensures that you take the minimum number of jumps to reach the end.

### Code Explanation:

- **Initialization**: 
    - `l, r` are initialized to `0`, representing the range you're considering at any step.
    - `res` is initialized to `0` to keep count of the number of jumps.

- **While Loop**: `while r < (len(nums) - 1):`
    - It continues until the right boundary `r` crosses or reaches the end of the array. 

- **Finding the Maximum Possible Jump**:
    - `for i in range(l, r + 1):`
        - This loop iterates over the current range (`l` to `r`). For each `i` in this range, it calculates how far it can jump from `i` (`i + nums[i]`) and updates `maxJump` if it finds a farther possible jump.
    - Once the loop is done, `maxJump` holds the farthest index we can jump to from the current range.

- **Update the Range**: 
    - `l` is updated to `r + 1` since, in the next iteration, we want to explore from where our previous range ended.
    - `r` is updated to `maxJump`, as this is the furthest we can reach in the next step.

- **Increment Jumps**:
    - With each iteration of the while loop, `res` (number of jumps) is incremented.

- **Return**: 
    - Once the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is the minimum number of jumps needed.

### Why the loop and variables?
1. **While loop**: To iterate and simulate the jumps till we reach the end of the array.
2. **`l` and `r` variables**: Define the current range being evaluated. They help in confining our exploration to possible jumps within a certain boundary.
3. **`maxJump` variable**: Stores the maximum jump possible from the current range. Helps in deciding the next range to evaluate.
4. **`res` variable**: To count the number of jumps required.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\). In the worst case, each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\). Only a constant amount of extra space (for variables) is used, regardless of the input size.

### Summary:
This approach is a **BFS and Greedy Hybrid**. It starts with the range `[0, 0]` and tries to find the farthest it can jump from within this range. The range is then updated to the newly discovered boundaries, and the process repeats. The number of times the boundaries are updated gives us the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array.
