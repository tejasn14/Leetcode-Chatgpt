### First Principles Thinking:

1. **Fundamental Truths**: 
   - The string `s` needs to be partitioned into parts.
   - Each letter should appear in at most one part.
   
2. **Objective**: 
   - To find a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
   
3. **Constraints**: 
   - After concatenating all the parts, the resultant string should be `s`.

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:

A naive approach would be to iterate through the string and for each character, search for its last occurrence in the string. Use these positions to define partitions. But this is inefficient because we might have to iterate multiple times for each character.

#### Programming/Coding Principles:

- **Raw Algorithm**:
  - For each character, identify its last occurrence in the string.
  - Use these positions to define partitions.

- **Data Structures**: 
  - Array to store partition sizes.

- **Loops**: 
  - Nested `for` loop for each character to find its last occurrence.

- **Update Criteria**: 
  - Update the partition size based on the positions of the last occurrence of characters.

- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
  - Base Case: Once the string is fully iterated, the base case is reached.
  - Edge Case: Strings with unique characters will have partitions of size 1.

#### Python Code for Brute Force Approach:

```python
def partitionLabels(s):
    partition_sizes = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        last_occurrence = s.rfind(s[i])
        partition_size = last_occurrence - i + 1
        partition_sizes.append(partition_size)
    return partition_sizes

# Not efficient and doesn't solve the problem completely
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the size of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

### Optimized Approaches:

#### Intuition and Train of Thought for Optimization:

Rather than finding the last occurrence of each character multiple times, we can pre-compute these positions and use a variable to keep track of the end of each partition.

#### Step-by-step Transition:

1. First, iterate through the string to store the last occurrence of each character.
2. Then, iterate through the string again to find partitions.

#### Programming/Coding Principles for Optimized Approach:

- **Raw Algorithm**:
  1. Pre-compute the last occurrence for each character.
  2. Iterate through the string again to find partitions using these last occurrences.

- **Data Structures**: 
  - Dictionary to store last occurrences.
  - List to store partition sizes.

- **Loops**: 
  - Single `for` loop to iterate through the string.

- **Update Criteria**: 
  - Update the end of the partition based on the last occurrences.

- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
  - Base Case: When the iteration reaches the end of a partition, append its size to the list.

#### Python Code for the Optimized Solution:

```python
def partitionLabels(s):
    last_occurrences = {char: index for index, char in enumerate(s)}
    start, end = 0, 0
    partition_sizes = []
    
    for index, char in enumerate(s):
        end = max(end, last_occurrences[char])
        if index == end:
            partition_sizes.append(end - start + 1)
            start = end + 1
            
    return partition_sizes

# Test the function
print(partitionLabels("ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"))  # Should return [9,7,8]
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since the maximum number of unique characters is constant (26).

### Strategies and Techniques:

1. **Pre-Computation**: Pre-computing some information (like last occurrences here) can save computation time later.
2. **Two-Pass Algorithm**: Sometimes two passes through the data can lead to a more efficient algorithm.
3. **Greedy Method**: We greedily extend the end of each partition as far as it needs to go.

These strategies can be used in other problems where you need to partition a sequence based on some criteria or when you need to pre-compute some information to make the main computation more efficient.



Certainly, let's dive into these two different approaches for solving the problem of checking whether a string with parenthesis and asterisks can form a balanced set of parenthesis. We'll go step-by-step, following your desired pattern.

### First Principles Thinking:
The core issue is to verify if a given string of parentheses and asterisks can form a balanced set of parentheses. A balanced set of parentheses means that for every opening parenthesis `(`, there should be a corresponding closing parenthesis `)` that matches it.

#### Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach
##### Explanation
The DP approach uses memoization to save already computed values for subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

###### Programming/Coding Principles
1. **Why Recursion & Memoization**: We can use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems. Memoization, storing the results of expensive function calls, is used here to avoid recomputation.

2. **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary `dp` to store the memoized results. The key is a tuple `(i, left)` that represents the state of the string at index `i` with `left` open parentheses.

3. **Why 'dfs' function**: It serves as our recursive function that checks the validity of the string for each subproblem and saves the result in `dp`.

4. **Base Cases and Edge Cases**: 
    - If `i` becomes equal to the length of the string, or if `left` becomes negative, then the base case triggers.
    - If the number of open brackets is zero at the end, the string is valid.

###### Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        dp = {(len(s), 0): True}

        def dfs(i, left):
            if i == len(s) or left < 0:
                return left == 0
            if (i, left) in dp:
                return dp[(i, left)]

            if s[i] == "(":
                dp[(i, left)] = dfs(i + 1, left + 1)
            elif s[i] == ")":
                dp[(i, left)] = dfs(i + 1, left - 1)
            else:
                dp[(i, left)] = (
                    dfs(i + 1, left + 1) or dfs(i + 1, left - 1) or dfs(i + 1, left)
                )
            return dp[(i, left)]

        return dfs(0, 0)
```

###### Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\)  
Space Complexity: \(O(n)\)

#### [[Greedy]] Approach
##### Explanation
This algorithm uses a greedy approach to keep track of the minimum and maximum number of open parentheses that could be valid.

###### Programming/Coding Principles
1. **Why Two Variables `leftMin` and `leftMax`**: We maintain these to represent the range of valid open parentheses at any given point.
  
2. **Why a Single Pass Loop**: This greedy approach lets us solve the problem in a single pass through the string, updating `leftMin` and `leftMax` on the fly.
  
3. **Base Cases and Edge Cases**: 
    - If `leftMax` becomes negative, return False immediately.
    - If `leftMin` becomes negative, reset it to zero.

###### Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        leftMin, leftMax = 0, 0

        for c in s:
            if c == "(":
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin + 1, leftMax + 1
            elif c == ")":
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin - 1, leftMax - 1
            else:
                leftMin, leftMax = leftMin - 1, leftMax + 1
            if leftMax < 0:
                return False
            if leftMin < 0:
                leftMin = 0
        return leftMin == 0
```

###### Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)  
Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

#### Strategies and Techniques
1. **Recursion + Memoization**: Useful when subproblems are solved multiple times.
  
2. **Greedy**: Effective when solving the problem in one pass is possible, and you need a more optimized solution.

Both these approaches can be generalized to similar problems involving string manipulation, parentheses matching, and state-based problems.
