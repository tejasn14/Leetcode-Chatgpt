```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if p and q and p.val == q.val:
            return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        else:
            return False

```

Let's dissect the problem of determining if two binary trees are identical in structure and value.

### The Problem:
The task is to check if two given binary trees `p` and `q` are exactly the same in structure and in node values.

### First Principles:
1. Two trees are identical if they have the same root values, their left subtrees are identical, and their right subtrees are identical.
2. A tree comparison is inherently a recursive problem. The process of comparing two trees can be broken down into smaller sub-problems (comparing the respective subtrees).

### Solving Intuition:
Begin at the root. If the root values of `p` and `q` are the same, then check if the left subtree of `p` is the same as the left subtree of `q` and if the right subtree of `p` is the same as the right subtree of `q`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we have to visit all nodes of both trees.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), h = n, so space complexity is O(n).

### Raw Algorithm:
1. Compare the current nodes of `p` and `q`.
2. If they're the same, then recursively compare their left children and right children.
3. If at any step, the nodes aren't the same, return False. Otherwise, return True.

### Programming Approach:
- **if not p and not q**: This is the base case. If at any stage of the recursion, both the nodes are null, then those subtrees are identical.
- **if p and q and p.val == q.val**: This checks three conditions:
  1. Both nodes are not null.
  2. The value of the current node in `p` is the same as the current node in `q`.
  3. Recursively check the left and right subtrees.
- **else**: If none of the above conditions are satisfied, then the trees aren't identical.

### Why the Data Structures:
- **Recursive function (`isSameTree`)**: It is a suitable way to traverse both trees simultaneously and compare them at every step.

### Base Cases:
- Both nodes `p` and `q` are null. This ensures that two null subtrees are considered the same.
- If only one of them is null (handled by the `else` condition), then they aren't identical.

### Edge Cases:
- One or both of the trees are empty.
- One tree is a subtree of the other but not identical.
- Trees with similar structure but different values.

### Optimizing Clues:
The given method is already optimized since it employs a short-circuiting mechanism. If at any step the trees are found to be different, the recursion stops, and the result is returned immediately.

### Mnemonics to Remember:
**"Same Roots, Same Offshoots."**  
The core idea is that if the roots (current nodes) are the same and their offshoots (children) are the same, then the entire trees are the same.

To summarize, this solution employs a recursive, depth-first approach to traverse and compare every node in the two trees. The elegance lies in its simplicity and short-circuiting mechanism that stops the process as soon as a difference is detected.
