```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        q = collections.deque()
        if root:
            q.append(root)

        while q:
            val = []

            for i in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                val.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            res.append(val)
        return res

```

Absolutely! Let's delve into this binary tree problem using a structured approach.

### Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree, return the level-order traversal of its nodes' values. In simpler terms, return the values of nodes level by level.

### First Principles:
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Solving Intuition:
To achieve level-order traversal, a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy is required. This is usually done using a queue to maintain the order in which nodes are visited.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily because of the queue. In the worst case, it can hold all nodes at the deepest level which can be n/2 nodes at max.

### Raw Algorithm:
1. Initialize a queue and add the root node to it.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   1. Note the number of elements currently in the queue. This count represents all nodes at the current depth.
   2. For each node at the current depth:
      1. Dequeue the node.
      2. Add its value to a temporary list.
      3. Enqueue the node's children (left, then right) if they exist.
   3. Add the temporary list to the result list.

### Programming Approach:
- **res**: This is the result list that will hold lists of values at each depth.
- **q**: A queue that assists in BFS traversal.
- **while q**: Process nodes while there are nodes remaining to be processed in the queue.
- **for i in range(len(q))**: For each depth level, we process all nodes at that level (hence why we need the length of `q` at the start of each loop).
- **node = q.popleft()**: Remove and get the front node from the queue.
- **val.append(node.val)**: Append the value of the node to the current level's list.
- **if node.left**: Check for left child and enqueue if it exists.
- **if node.right**: Check for right child and enqueue if it exists.
- **res.append(val)**: After processing all nodes at the current depth, append the `val` list to the result `res`.

### Why the While Loop:
The while loop ensures we continue processing nodes as long as there are nodes left in the queue. This guarantees all nodes in the tree are processed.

### Why the Variables:
- **res**: To store the level-wise node values.
- **q**: To perform BFS traversal.
- **val**: Temporary list to store node values for the current level.

### Why the Data Structure:
- **Deque (from collections)**: A double-ended queue that allows for efficient O(1) append and pop operations from both ends. It's used for BFS traversal in this problem, making it the perfect choice over lists which aren't efficient when popping elements from the front.

### Base Cases:
- **if root**: The initial check ensures that we don't attempt to process an empty tree.

### Edge Cases:
- **Unbalanced trees**: Even if the tree is skewed or unbalanced, the algorithm will work fine. The worst-case scenario involves all nodes of the deepest level in the queue, which is manageable.

### Optimizing Clues:
The given approach is already quite optimized for level-order traversal. One could ponder upon parallelization for very large trees, but it's generally overkill and would make the solution more complex.

### Mnemonics to Remember:
**"Queue for Levels"**: Remember that for level-order or BFS traversal in trees, queues are your best friend. They ensure nodes are processed in the order they're discovered.

In summary, this solution uses the deque data structure to perform a BFS traversal on the tree, collecting nodes' values level by level and storing them in the result list `res`.
