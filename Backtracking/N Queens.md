### First Principles Thinking:

1. **Fundamental Truths**: 
    - We have an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
    - A queen can move vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

2. **Objective**: 
    - Place \( n \) queens on the board such that no two queens attack each other.
  
3. **Constraints**:
    - \( 1 \leq n \leq 9 \)

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:

1. We can use a 2D grid to represent the board and perform a complete search to try out all possible board configurations.

#### Programming/Coding Principles:

- **Raw Algorithm**:
    1. Use a 2D array to represent the board.
    2. Place a queen in a row and move to the next row.
    3. Repeat until the last row, checking at each step if the board is valid.
  
- **Data Structures**: 
    - 2D array to represent the board.
  
- **Loops**: 
    - Nested loop to go through each cell.
  
- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
    - Base Case: All \( n \) queens have been placed without any conflicts.
    - Edge Case: \( n = 1 \) will only have one solution, [["Q"]].

#### Python Code for the Brute Force Approach:

The brute-force approach would be highly inefficient for this problem, so we'll go ahead and discuss the optimized approach.

### Optimized Approaches:

#### [[Backtracking]]

1. **Intuition and Train of Thought**: 
    - Rather than trying all possible positions for each queen, use backtracking to place queens row-by-row while keeping track of the columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals that are already being attacked.

2. **Step-by-step Transition**: 
    - Place a queen in the first row, then move to the next row, making sure to update the sets that keep track of attacked positions.
    - If you reach a row where no placement is valid, backtrack to the previous row and move that queen.
  
3. **Programming/Coding Principles**:

    - **Data Structures**: Lists to represent the board and sets to keep track of attacked positions.
    - **Loops**: Loop through each row.
    - **Base Case**: All \( n \) queens are placed.
    - **Edge Case**: \( n = 1 \) has a single solution.

#### Python Code for the Optimized Solution:

```python
def solveNQueens(n):
    def backtrack(row, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, path):
        if row == n:
            result.append(path)
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if col in cols or row + col in diagonals or row - col in anti_diagonals:
                continue
            cols.add(col)
            diagonals.add(row + col)
            anti_diagonals.add(row - col)
            backtrack(row + 1, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, path + ["." * col + "Q" + "." * (n - col - 1)])
            cols.remove(col)
            diagonals.remove(row + col)
            anti_diagonals.remove(row - col)

    result = []
    backtrack(0, set(), set(), set(), [])
    return result
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N!)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\)

### Strategies and Techniques:

1. **Backtracking for Constraint Satisfaction**: This problem is a classic example of using backtracking to solve constraint satisfaction problems.
2. **Pruning**: We use sets to keep track of attacked positions, effectively pruning the search space.

This approach of backtracking combined with effective pruning can be generalized to solve similar constraint satisfaction problems.

        col = set()
        posDiag = set()  # (r + c)

                posDiag.remove(r + c)
                negDiag.remove(r - c)
                board[r][c] = "."

        backtrack(0)
        return res

```

Let's break down the problem and solution using the 1st principles of problem-solving approach:

### Problem-Solving Approach:

**Understanding the Problem**:
Given an `n x n` chessboard, place `n` queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. Return all distinct solutions.

### Solving Intuition:

The key observation is that a queen threatens another queen if they're on the same row, same column, or the same diagonal. Hence, in a valid solution, each row must have exactly one queen, and so must each column. Furthermore, diagonals which contain queens must not intersect.

### Raw Algorithm:

1. Use backtracking to explore all possible positions of placing queens row by row.
2. For each row, try placing a queen in each column and check if it's a valid position (i.e., it doesn't conflict with previously placed queens).

### Why The Code Is Written The Way It Is:

1. **Sets `col`, `posDiag`, and `negDiag`**: To quickly verify if placing a queen on a specific spot is valid, we need to check the columns and the two diagonals. Using sets gives O(1) complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
   - `col` set ensures that no two queens share the same column.
   - `posDiag` and `negDiag` are a clever way to check diagonals. For any cell `(r, c)`, cells on its positive diagonal (`/`) have the same `r+c` value, and cells on its negative diagonal (`\`) have the same `r-c` value.

2. **Why `backtrack(r)` function?**: This function explores placing a queen on row `r`. We recurse row by row, placing a queen and then proceeding to the next row.

3. **Base Case inside `backtrack`**: When `r == n`, it means a queen has been placed on every row, indicating a complete solution.

4. **`if c in col or (r + c) in posDiag or (r - c) in negDiag:`**: Before placing a queen, we ensure that the current cell doesn't lie in a column or diagonal that already has a queen.

5. **`board` variable**: This 2D list represents the chessboard. We use it to construct the solution once we've placed all the queens.

6. **Why do we remove from sets and reset the board after the recursive call?**: This is the essence of backtracking. We undo the changes so that we can explore other potential solutions.

### Time Complexity:

**O(N!)**: In the worst case, we could consider it similar to permutation for placement of queens. However, it's much better in practice due to early pruning (we skip invalid positions early on).

### Space Complexity:

**O(N)**: While the board itself is `n x n`, our recursive call stack (depth of recursion) will be `N` deep, and our sets will store at most `N` elements each.

### Base Cases and Edge Cases:

1. **Base Case inside `backtrack`**: A solution is found when we've placed queens on all rows, i.e., `r == n`.
2. **Edge Cases**: The solution is general and does not have specific edge cases apart from the base case.

### Optimizing Clues:

1. **Bitsets**: Rather than using sets, some optimizations can be achieved using bitsets to represent columns and diagonals.
2. **Symmetry**: Half of the solutions are symmetric, so we can just generate half and then derive the rest.

### Mnemonics to Remember:

1. **"Row by Row"**: Remind yourself that you're placing queens row by row.
2. **"Col and Diags"**: These are the key entities we need to watch out for conflicts. Using `col`, `posDiag`, and `negDiag` helps us keep track of threats efficiently.
3. **"Backtrack the Board"**: At the heart of the solution is a backtracking approach, where we explore potential placements and undo them if they don't lead to a solution.

By understanding the rules of chess, particularly how the queen moves, and by employing a backtracking technique, the solution explores all possible configurations of queens on the board, returning those that meet the criteria.
