### First Principles Thinking:

1. **Fundamental Truths**: 
    - We have an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
    - A queen can move vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

2. **Objective**: 
    - Place \( n \) queens on the board such that no two queens attack each other.
  
3. **Constraints**:
    - \( 1 \leq n \leq 9 \)

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:

1. We can use a 2D grid to represent the board and perform a complete search to try out all possible board configurations.

#### Programming/Coding Principles:

- **Raw Algorithm**:
    1. Use a 2D array to represent the board.
    2. Place a queen in a row and move to the next row.
    3. Repeat until the last row, checking at each step if the board is valid.
  
- **Data Structures**: 
    - 2D array to represent the board.
  
- **Loops**: 
    - Nested loop to go through each cell.
  
- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
    - Base Case: All \( n \) queens have been placed without any conflicts.
    - Edge Case: \( n = 1 \) will only have one solution, [["Q"]].

#### Python Code for the Brute Force Approach:

The brute-force approach would be highly inefficient for this problem, so we'll go ahead and discuss the optimized approach.

### Optimized Approaches:

#### [[Backtracking]]

1. **Intuition and Train of Thought**: 
    - Rather than trying all possible positions for each queen, use backtracking to place queens row-by-row while keeping track of the columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals that are already being attacked.

2. **Step-by-step Transition**: 
    - Place a queen in the first row, then move to the next row, making sure to update the sets that keep track of attacked positions.
    - If you reach a row where no placement is valid, backtrack to the previous row and move that queen.
  
3. **Programming/Coding Principles**:

    - **Data Structures**: Lists to represent the board and sets to keep track of attacked positions.
    - **Loops**: Loop through each row.
    - **Base Case**: All \( n \) queens are placed.
    - **Edge Case**: \( n = 1 \) has a single solution.

#### Python Code for the Optimized Solution:

```python
def solveNQueens(n):
    def backtrack(row, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, path):
        if row == n:
            result.append(path)
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if col in cols or row + col in diagonals or row - col in anti_diagonals:
                continue
            cols.add(col)
            diagonals.add(row + col)
            anti_diagonals.add(row - col)
            backtrack(row + 1, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, path + ["." * col + "Q" + "." * (n - col - 1)])
            cols.remove(col)
            diagonals.remove(row + col)
            anti_diagonals.remove(row - col)

    result = []
    backtrack(0, set(), set(), set(), [])
    return result
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N!)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\)

### Strategies and Techniques:

1. **Backtracking for Constraint Satisfaction**: This problem is a classic example of using backtracking to solve constraint satisfaction problems.
2. **Pruning**: We use sets to keep track of attacked positions, effectively pruning the search space.

This approach of backtracking combined with effective pruning can be generalized to solve similar constraint satisfaction problems.
