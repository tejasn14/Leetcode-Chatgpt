### First Principles Thinking:

1. **Fundamental Truths**: 
    - We have an array `nums` containing distinct integers.
  
2. **Objective**: 
    - To return a list containing all possible permutations of integers from `nums`.

3. **Constraints**: 
    - 1 <= nums.length <= 6
    - -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
    - All integers of `nums` are unique.

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:

The brute-force approach is to use recursion to generate all possible permutations of the list. We will take one element at a time and then permute the remaining elements. 

#### Programming/Coding Principles:

- **Raw Algorithm**: 
    1. Start with an empty list to represent the current permutation.
    2. Recursively explore each element, adding it to the current permutation, and recursively permute the remaining elements.
  
- **Data Structures**: 
    - List to hold the result (list of permutations).
    - Temporary list to hold the current permutation.
    
- **Loops**: 
    - Recursion for iteration.
  
- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
    - Base Case: The list is empty.

#### Python Code for the Brute Force Approach:

```python
def permute(nums):
    res = []
    
    def dfs(path, remaining):
        if not remaining:
            res.append(path[:])
            return
        for i in range(len(remaining)):
            dfs(path + [remaining[i]], remaining[:i] + remaining[i+1:])
    
    dfs([], nums)
    return res
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N!)\), \(N\) being the length of `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the recursion stack.

### Optimized Approaches:

Given the nature of the problem and the constraints (maximum 6 numbers, all unique), the brute-force method is already efficient enough. Generating permutations is inherently \(O(N!)\) as that is the number of permutations possible.

### Strategies and Techniques:

1. **Recursion for Permutational Problems**: Recursion is an effective technique for generating all possible permutations.
2. **Use of DFS for Generating Combinations/Permutations**: Depth-first search can be quite useful for generating combinations and permutations.

This strategy can be applied to any problem where you need to generate a power set, combinations, or permutations.

### Neetcode

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        # base case
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return [nums[:]]  # nums[:] is a deep copy

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            n = nums.pop(0)
            perms = self.permute(nums)

            for perm in perms:
                perm.append(n)
            res.extend(perms)
            nums.append(n)
        return res
