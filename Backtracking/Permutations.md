### First Principles Thinking:

1. **Fundamental Truths**: 
    - We have an array `nums` containing distinct integers.
  
2. **Objective**: 
    - To return a list containing all possible permutations of integers from `nums`.

3. **Constraints**: 
    - 1 <= nums.length <= 6
    - -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
    - All integers of `nums` are unique.

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:

The brute-force approach is to use recursion to generate all possible permutations of the list. We will take one element at a time and then permute the remaining elements. 

#### Programming/Coding Principles:

- **Raw Algorithm**: 
    1. Start with an empty list to represent the current permutation.
    2. Recursively explore each element, adding it to the current permutation, and recursively permute the remaining elements.
  
- **Data Structures**: 
    - List to hold the result (list of permutations).
    - Temporary list to hold the current permutation.
    
- **Loops**: 
    - Recursion for iteration.
  
- **Base Case and Edge Case**: 
    - Base Case: The list is empty.

#### Python Code for the Brute Force Approach:

```python
def permute(nums):
    res = []
    
    def dfs(path, remaining):
        if not remaining:
            res.append(path[:])
            return
        for i in range(len(remaining)):
            dfs(path + [remaining[i]], remaining[:i] + remaining[i+1:])
    
    dfs([], nums)
    return res
```

#### Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N!)\), \(N\) being the length of `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the recursion stack.

### Optimized Approaches:

Given the nature of the problem and the constraints (maximum 6 numbers, all unique), the brute-force method is already efficient enough. Generating permutations is inherently \(O(N!)\) as that is the number of permutations possible.

### Strategies and Techniques:

1. **Recursion for Permutational Problems**: Recursion is an effective technique for generating all possible permutations.
2. **Use of DFS for Generating Combinations/Permutations**: Depth-first search can be quite useful for generating combinations and permutations.

This strategy can be applied to any problem where you need to generate a power set, combinations, or permutations.

### Neetcode

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        # base case
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return [nums[:]]  # nums[:] is a deep copy

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            n = nums.pop(0)
            perms = self.permute(nums)

            for perm in perms:
                perm.append(n)
            res.extend(perms)
            nums.append(n)
        return res

```

The given `Solution` class provides a function `permute` which finds all possible permutations of the input list `nums`. Let's break it down using the 1st principles approach.

### Problem-Solving Approach:

**Understanding the Problem**: 
Given a list of numbers, the problem asks for all possible ways these numbers can be arranged, i.e., all possible permutations.

### Solving Intuition:

**Recursive Breakdown**: The intuition is to fix one number and find permutations for the rest, then combine them. For instance, if we're trying to find permutations of [1, 2, 3], we can fix '1' and find permutations of [2, 3] which are [2, 3] and [3, 2]. Then we can combine '1' with these to get [1, 2, 3] and [1, 3, 2]. We repeat the process for '2' and '3'.

### Key Components:

#### 1. Base Case:
- If `nums` contains just one number, it returns a deep copy of `nums` as the only possible permutation.

#### 2. Recursive Case:
- For each number in `nums`:
  - It's temporarily removed.
  - The recursive function is called on the remaining numbers.
  - The removed number is appended to each of these smaller permutations.
  - The removed number is then added back to the original list `nums`.

### Time Complexity:

**O(n!)** - There are n! (n factorial) permutations of a list of size n. For each number, we're recursively finding permutations for the rest. 

### Space Complexity:

**O(n!)** - In the worst case, we will store all n! permutations in the `res` list.

### Why The Code Is Written The Way It Is:

1. **Why Recursion?**: The nature of the problem suits a recursive approach. Fixing a number and finding permutations of the rest naturally reduces the problem size.

2. **Why pop and append?**: Popping the number ensures it's temporarily removed, while appending it back restores the original list for subsequent iterations.

3. **Why deep copy in the base case?**: It ensures that the original list or its subsequent versions aren't modified in recursive calls. A shallow copy would lead to undesired changes in the original list.

### Base Cases and Edge Cases:

1. **List of one number**: The base case ensures that if `nums` contains just one number, the function returns it as the only permutation.

2. **Empty list**: The function doesn't handle it explicitly. If required, an additional base case can be added.

### Optimizing Clues:

1. **Avoiding pop and append**: Using indices instead of modifying the list can be more efficient. For example, passing a subset of `nums` without the current number instead of popping it.

2. **Backtracking**: Another common approach to solve this problem is to use backtracking, which might provide a clearer and potentially faster method to generate all permutations.

### Mnemonics to Remember:

1. **"Pop, Permute, Append"**: This sequence gives a natural flow to the recursive approach. You pop a number, find permutations for the rest, and then append the number to these permutations.

2. **"Deep for Keep"**: Remember to use deep copies to keep the original structure intact during recursive calls.

3. **"Fix and Mix"**: The core idea is fixing one number and mixing the rest to get permutations.

In essence, the `permute` function offers a recursive way to generate permutations by reducing the problem size with each recursive call. The problem and its solution highlight the importance of understanding the nature of the problem and tailoring the approach to suit this nature.
