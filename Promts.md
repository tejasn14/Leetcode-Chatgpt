>What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?

I am a noob in programming and problem-solving leetcode. I aspire to become the greatest leetcode problem solver. I want to understand different ways of approaching a problem, and strategize to find the best solution. I want to start with brute force improving and optimizing my solution every step till the optimal time and space complexity is reached.  I have difficulty in converting my solution approach to code. I wish to understand the best coding principles  like how to come up with raw algorithm for the particular problem, how to write optimized python code , best data structure to use, while or for loop, top down or bottom approach, update rule, base cases, edge cases etc.I have also have difficulty remembering the solution after few days. So I want mnemonics support to help me recall the solution for the question at hand. I believe in the First Principles Approach and would like to think critically and make connections to other LeetCode Blind 150 problems

1. First Principles Thinking: Identify fundamental truths about the problem and reason up from there. How to approach the problem using first principles
2.Give me multiple approached to solve the problem starting from brute force , to near optimized to most optimized. Keep improving the solution every step till the best solution is reached.  Follow the below pattern for any other approaches other than brute force.
**Brute Force Approach**:
    - Explanation of the naive solution.
    - Programming/Coding Principles- How to come up with the programming logic/approach, raw algorithm, optimised code like Best data structure, minimum number of variables, for/while loop, update criteria, base case, edge case etc. 
    - Python code for the brute force approach.
    - Analysis of time and space complexity.
 **Optimized Approaches**:
    - Intuition and train of thought leading to optimization.
    - Step-by-step transition from the previous solution to the current optimal solution.
    - Programming/Coding Principles- How to come up with the programming logic/approach, raw algorithm, optimized code like Best data structure, minimum number of variables, for/while loop, update criteria, base case, edge case etc. 
    - Python code for the optimized solution.
    - Analysis of time and space complexity.
4. Strategies and Techniques: Highlight strategies that can be generalized to similar problems.â€¨
*Complete the solution in multiple responses/ chats if the per chat limit is reached*



### To understand Neet-code solution
Explain this in great detail using 1st principles of problem-solving approach, how to come up with the solving intuition, time/space complexity, the raw algorithm of the code, and how to come up with the programming approach(why the code is written the way it is written - why the while loop, why the variables, why the data structure like heaps, stacks, queues, dictionaries, sets(), trees, tries, etc, base cases, edge cases ), further optimizing clues, mnemonics to remember the solution
