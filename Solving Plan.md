As before, follow the daily routine to maximize understanding and retention. For trees and graphs, pay close attention to traversal techniques and properties that make these data structures unique.

For tree problems, consider both recursive and iterative approaches, understand how to identify base cases, and think about any balancing that might be needed.

For graph problems, consider the types of graphs you're dealing with (directed, undirected, weighted, etc.) and the best ways to represent them in code (adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, etc.).

In Dynamic Programming problems, it's essential to identify the subproblems and determine whether a top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation) approach will be more efficient. 

For backtracking problems, understand the problem's constraints and structure your recursive calls carefully. Make sure to backtrack (undo your decisions) as you return from the recursion to explore other possibilities.

Would you like to review any strategies for tackling these types of problems, or shall we proceed to wrap up the 30-day plan?
