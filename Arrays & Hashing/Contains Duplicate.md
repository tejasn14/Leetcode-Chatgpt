### First Principles Thinking

The problem essentially asks us to find out if there are any duplicates in the given array. The fundamental truths about the problem are:

1. We are given an array of integers.
2. The array can contain both negative and positive numbers.
3. We need to find out if any number appears more than once in the array.

Starting from these principles, one way to solve the problem is by checking every pair of elements in the array to see if there are duplicates. Another way could involve sorting the array first and then checking adjacent elements. More optimized solutions could involve data structures like hash sets.

### Brute Force Approach:

#### Explanation:
- We can use two nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the array. If we find any two elements that are the same, then we return `true`; otherwise, `false`.

#### Programming/Coding Principles:
- We need two nested `for` loops to compare each pair of elements.

#### Python Code:

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                return True
    return False
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\), as we are using nested loops.
- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

### Optimized Approaches:

#### Approach 1: Sorting

##### Intuition:
- If we sort the array first, then all duplicates will become neighbors. We can then simply scan the array once to check for duplicates.

##### Transition from Brute Force:
- Instead of using nested loops, we sort the array first, which allows us to identify duplicates in a single loop.

##### Programming/Coding Principles:
- Use Python's built-in sort method to sort the array.
- Use a `for` loop to check for adjacent elements being the same.

##### Python Code:

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    nums.sort()
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
            return True
    return False
```

##### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: \(O(n  log n)\) for sorting and \(O(n)\) for scanning, so overall \(O(n log n)\).
- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\).

#### Approach 2: Using Hash Set

##### Intuition:
- We can use a hash set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. If we encounter an element that is already in the set, we return `true`.

##### Transition from Sorting:
- Instead of sorting and then scanning, we scan the array once, using a hash set to keep track of seen elements.

##### Programming/Coding Principles:
- Use a `set` data structure to keep track of the elements.
- Use a `for` loop to scan the array once.

##### Python Code:

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

##### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: \(O(n)\), as we scan the array once.
- Space Complexity: \(O(n)\), for the hash set.

### Strategies and Techniques:
1. Nested Loops: Useful when you have to compare each element with every other element, but should be avoided if possible due to high time complexity.
2. Sorting: Useful when the relative order of elements can be exploited to simplify the problem.
3. Hash Set: Extremely useful for keeping track of seen elements, especially when you need to check for duplicates or find unique elements.

### Neetcode

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashset = set()

        for n in nums:
            if n in hashset:
                return True
            hashset.add(n)
        return False

```

### First Principles Thinking

1. **Fundamental Truths**: In this problem, you're asked to find if there are any duplicate elements in a given list of integers.
2. **Constraints**: No constraint on list length or element size, but it's understood that time and space should be minimized.
3. **Building Up**: The simplest way to identify duplicates is to compare every element with every other element. However, this would be time-consuming. A better method would be to store each unique element in a data structure that allows fast retrieval.

#### Intuition

1. **Hashing**: The primary intuition here is that you need a quick way to look up whether you've already seen a number. Hashing is particularly good for this.

### Brute Force Approach

#### Explanation

1. **Naive Solution**: Loop through the list and for each element, check all the elements to its right to see if it appears again.
   
#### Programming/Coding Principles

1. **Raw Algorithm**:
   - For each element, loop through the rest of the list to check for duplicates.
   
2. **Data Structure**: A list.
  
3. **Looping Structure**: Nested `for` loops.
  
4. **Base Case**: N/A for this approach.

5. **Edge Case**: Empty list, single element list.

#### Python Code for Brute Force

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                return True
    return False
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) because of the nested loops.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as we are not using any extra space.

### Optimized Approaches

#### Intuition and Train of Thought

1. **Using Hashing**: To speed this up, you can use a set to keep track of elements you have seen so far.

#### Step-by-step Transition

1. Instead of checking each element with every other element, check whether it already exists in the set.
  
2. If it exists, you found a duplicate. Otherwise, add the element to the set.

#### Programming/Coding Principles

1. **Raw Algorithm**: Loop through the list, add each new element to the set. Before adding, check if it's already in the set.
   
2. **Data Structure**: Using a `set()` for faster lookup.
   
3. **Looping Structure**: Single `for` loop.
   
4. **Update Criteria**: If an element is found in the set, return True; else continue.
  
5. **Base Case**: If list is empty or has a single element, then no duplicates.

6. **Edge Case**: The algorithm also works for an empty list and will return False.

#### Python Code for Optimized Approach

You've already provided the code. Here it is for reference.

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashset = set()
        for n in nums:
            if n in hashset:
                return True
            hashset.add(n)
        return False
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), because we only loop through the list once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), because in the worst case, the set will contain all elements.

### Strategies and Techniques

1. **Hashing**: Good for quick look-up and check if an element exists.

2. **Early Termination**: As soon as a duplicate is found, the function returns `True`.

### Mnemonics

1. **Remember "HSF"**: HashSet and For-loop.
   
2. **"Early Bird"**: The function terminates early as soon as a duplicate is found.

By understanding the transition from a brute-force approach to an optimized one, you can apply similar strategies to problems that require quick look-up or membership checking.
