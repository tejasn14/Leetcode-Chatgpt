### First Principles Thinking

The problem asks to return a new array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the product of all elements in the array except `nums[i]`. Constraints and requirements are:

1. The array's length \( n \) is not explicitly stated but should fit within a reasonable bound based on the problem's context.
2. The elements in the array are integers that fit within a 32-bit integer.
3. Must solve the problem in \( O(n) \) time complexity without using division.
4. The follow-up is about achieving \( O(1) \) extra space complexity.

The fundamental issue is to calculate the product of elements to the left and right of each index \( i \) and then multiply them to get the answer.

### Brute Force Approach

#### Explanation

- For each element \( i \), traverse the array to find the product of all other elements.

#### Programming/Coding Principles

- Use nested loops to find the product for each element \( i \).

#### Python Code

```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    answer = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                product *= nums[j]
        answer.append(product)
        
    return answer
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: \( O(n^2) \)
- Space Complexity: \( O(n) \)

### Optimized Approach: \( O(n) \) Time and \( O(n) \) Space

#### Intuition

- Compute products to the left and right of each element separately, and then combine them.

#### Transition from Brute Force

- Avoid repeated calculations by using two separate arrays for storing the left and right products.

#### Programming/Coding Principles

- Use two arrays `left` and `right` to store the left and right products.

#### Python Code

```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    left = [1] * n
    right = [1] * n
    answer = [1] * n
    
    # Compute left products
    left_product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        left[i] = left_product
        left_product *= nums[i]
        
    # Compute right products
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right[i] = right_product
        right_product *= nums[i]
        
    # Compute answer
    for i in range(n):
        answer[i] = left[i] * right[i]
        
    return answer
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: \( O(n) \)
- Space Complexity: \( O(n) \)

### Optimized Approach: \( O(n) \) Time and \( O(1) \) Space (Follow-up)

#### Intuition

- Use the output array `answer` to store the left products temporarily and then update it with the final answer.

#### Transition from Previous Solution

- Avoid using extra space by utilizing the `answer` array.

#### Python Code

```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    answer = [1] * n
    
    # Compute left products directly on the answer array
    left_product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        answer[i] = left_product
        left_product *= nums[i]
        
    # Compute the final answer array using right products
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        answer[i] *= right_product
        right_product *= nums[i]
        
    return answer
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: \( O(n) \)
- Space Complexity: \( O(1) \) (excluding the output array)

### Strategies and Techniques

1. **Accumulative Product**: Using accumulative products to the left and right of each element can help reduce repeated calculations.
2. **Space Optimization**: Extra space can often be optimized by reusing existing data structures.

The follow-up requirement was to solve the problem using \( O(1) \) extra space, and the last approach achieves that by reusing the `answer` array.

#### Neetcode


```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1] * (len(nums))

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            res[i] = res[i-1] * nums[i-1]
        postfix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= postfix
            postfix *= nums[i]
        return res

```
### First Principles Thinking

1. **Fundamental Truths**: We are given an array of integers, and we need to find an output array such that the element at index `i` contains the product of all elements in the input array except for the element at index `i`.

2. **Constraints**:
    - We must not use division.
    - Solve the problem in \(O(N)\) time complexity.
    - Utilize \(O(1)\) extra space.

3. **Building Up**:
    - Intuitively, each element in the output array can be represented as the product of all numbers to its left multiplied by the product of all numbers to its right.

#### Intuition and Solving Intuition

1. **Identifying Patterns**: For each index `i`, the result would be a product of numbers before `i` and numbers after `i`.
2. **Zero Division Constraint**: We can't use division, which means that we need another way to multiply elements.
3. **Optimization**: To meet the time complexity constraints, we can perform this operation in one pass (or at most two passes) over the array.

### Explanation of Solution

#### Programming/Coding Principles

1. **Raw Algorithm**:
    - Calculate the prefix products for each index and store them in the result list `res`.
    - Iterate again to multiply the postfix products.

2. **Data Structure**:
    - List (`res`): To store the prefix products and eventually the final result.
  
3. **Looping Structure**: 
    - A `for` loop for prefix products.
    - Another `for` loop for postfix products.

4. **Variables**:
    - `res`: For storing prefix products initially and the result eventually.
    - `postfix`: Keeps track of the product of all elements from the current element to the last element.

5. **Update Criteria**: 
    - First, we populate `res` with prefix products.
    - Second, we multiply each element of `res` with the corresponding postfix product.

6. **Base Case**: 
    - `res` is initialized with 1s.
  
7. **Edge Cases**: 
    - Empty array: The function will return an empty array.

#### Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1] * (len(nums))

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            res[i] = res[i-1] * nums[i-1]
        postfix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= postfix
            postfix *= nums[i]
        return res
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\) — Two passes through the array of length \(N\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) — We are only using a constant amount of extra space (`postfix` variable).

### Strategies and Techniques

1. **Two-Pass Strategy**: When you need to look at elements both before and after the current index, consider using a two-pass strategy, one from left to right and the other from right to left.
  
2. **Prefix and Postfix Products**: When the result for each index depends on products or sums of other elements, prefix and postfix products/sums often provide a good solution.
#Tejas

### Mnemonics

1. **"Pre-Post Product"**: Remember that the result for each index comes from "pre" (prefix) and "post" (postfix) products. This should help you recall the two-pass strategy.
  
2. **"1-2-1 Loop"**: First loop populates the prefix, second multiplies with the postfix, and the `res` array is transformed from prefix to final output, capturing the 1-2-1 step sequence.

This methodology can be applied to similar problems where each element in the output array is a function of all other elements in the input array. It provides an efficient way to solve such problems without violating any constraints like not using division or needing to maintain a certain time or space complexity.
