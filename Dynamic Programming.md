### Top-down vs Bottom-up Approach in Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming (DP) problems can often be approached in two ways: top-down (also known as memoization) and bottom-up (also known as tabulation). Here's how you can think about implementing these approaches:

#### Top-down (Memoization)
1. **Recursive Function**: Start with a naive recursive solution that solves the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
2. **Memoization**: Add a memoization step where you check if the result for the current subproblem is already computed. If so, return it; otherwise, compute and store it.
3. **Base Cases**: Handle the base cases explicitly to terminate the recursion.

For Jump Game II, you might ask yourself:
- "What is the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end starting from index `i`?"
- "Have I computed this before? If so, what was the result?"

In a top-down approach, you would start by trying to solve for `memo[0]` (the minimum jumps required to reach the end from index 0). To do this, you'd break down the problem into subproblems based on where you could jump next.

#### Bottom-up (Tabulation)
1. **DP Array**: Create a DP array to store results of subproblems.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize the base cases in the DP array.
3. **Iteration**: Loop through the DP array, filling in solutions based on smaller, already-computed subproblems.
  
For Jump Game II, you would initialize `memo[-1] = 0` because no jumps are needed from the last index to itself. Then you might ask:
- "How can I fill in `memo[i]` based on the already-computed `memo[j]` for `j > i`?"

In this approach, you fill in the `memo` array iteratively, making sure each `memo[i]` is computed based on subproblems that have already been solved.

### Questions to Ask in Each Subproblem for Jump Game II

#### Top-down Approach
1. "From this index `i`, what are my options for the next jump?"
2. "If I take a jump to index `j`, what is the minimum number of jumps needed from `j` to the end?"
3. "Have I already computed the minimum number of jumps needed from index `j` to the end? If so, use that value; otherwise, compute it."

#### Bottom-up Approach
1. "I'm at index `i`. Can I reach this index from any previous indices?"
2. "If I can reach index `i` from a previous index `j`, what is the minimum number of jumps needed from `j` to `i`?"
3. "Is this new number of jumps less than the currently stored minimum number of jumps to reach index `i`? If so, update it."

### Detailed Explanation with [[Jump Game II]] Example

For simplicity, let's consider a smaller example: `[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`. The answer is `2`.

#### Top-down Approach
- You'd start by asking, "What's the minimum number of jumps to go from index 0 to the end?"
- To find that out, you'd consider jumping from index 0 to index 1 or 2. For each option, you'd ask, "What's the minimum number of jumps from here to the end?"
- You'd recurse like this, memoizing the result at each index.

Here's a sample Python code snippet:
```python
def jump(nums, i, memo):
    if i >= len(nums) - 1:
        return 0
    if memo[i] != -1:
        return memo[i]
    jumps = float('inf')
    for step in range(1, nums[i] + 1):
        if i + step < len(nums):
            jumps = min(jumps, 1 + jump(nums, i + step, memo))
    memo[i] = jumps
    return jumps

memo = [-1] * len(nums)
print(jump(nums, 0, memo))
```

#### Bottom-up Approach
- Initialize `memo[-1] = 0`.
- Going in reverse order, you'd fill in `memo[i]` by looking at the subsequent indices you can jump to from `i`.
- For each jump option, you'd find the minimum jumps needed and add 1.

Here's a sample Python code snippet:
```python
def jump(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    memo = [float('inf')] * n
    memo[-1] = 0
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(1, nums[i] + 1):
            if i + j < n:
                memo[i] = min(memo[i], 1 + memo[i + j])
    return memo[0]

nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
print(jump(nums))
```

By asking these questions, you can solve the problem efficiently while also ensuring that you understand the reasoning at each step. This aligns well with your goal to understand different ways of approaching a problem and to think critically using a First Principles Approach.
