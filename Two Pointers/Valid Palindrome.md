### First Principles Thinking

In the "Valid Palindrome" problem, the core objective is to determine if a given string is a palindrome. The fundamental truths about the problem are:

1. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
2. Only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) are considered, and the comparison should be case-insensitive.
3. Empty strings are palindromes.

### Brute Force Approach

#### Explanation of the Naive Solution
Create a new string that contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters from the original string. Then, check if this new string is a palindrome.

#### Programming/Coding Principles
- **Raw Algorithm**: Traverse the string to filter out alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase, then check for palindromes.
- **Data Structure**: Additional string to store alphanumeric characters.
- **For Loop**: One for-loop to filter and another to check for palindromes.
- **Base Case & Edge Case**: Handle cases when the string is empty or has one character.

#### Python Code for the Brute Force Approach
```python
def isPalindrome(s):
    alphanumeric_str = ""
    
    for char in s:
        if char.isalnum():
            alphanumeric_str += char.lower()
            
    return alphanumeric_str == alphanumeric_str[::-1]
```

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

### Optimized Approaches

#### Intuition and Train of Thought
To optimize, we can compare the string in-place without creating a new string. Use two pointers to compare characters from both ends.

#### Step-by-step Transition
1. Use two pointers: `left` and `right`.
2. Increment `left` or decrement `right` if non-alphanumeric characters are encountered.
3. Compare characters at the two pointers.

#### Programming/Coding Principles
- **Raw Algorithm**: Two-pointer technique to compare characters from both ends.
- **Data Structure**: None.
- **While Loop**: One loop for the two-pointer comparison.
- **Update Criteria**: Update `left` and `right` pointers.
- **Base Case & Edge Case**: Same as above.

#### Python Code for the Optimized Solution
```python
def isPalindrome(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return True
```

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)

### Strategies and Techniques
The two-pointer technique is a common strategy for solving problems where you need to compare elements from both ends of an array or string. This method helps to reduce extra space complexity by eliminating the need for an additional data structure.

The idea of filtering based on specific conditions (like `isalnum()`) while using two pointers can be generalized to other similar problems. Keep practicing and make connections with similar problems to internalize these techniques.

### NeetCode
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            while l < r and not self.alphanum(s[l]):
                l += 1
            while l < r and not self.alphanum(s[r]):
                r -= 1
            if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return True

    # Could write own alpha-numeric function
    def alphanum(self, c):
        return (
            ord("A") <= ord(c) <= ord("Z")
            or ord("a") <= ord(c) <= ord("z")
            or ord("0") <= ord(c) <= ord("9")
        )

```

### First Principles Thinking

1. **Fundamental Truths**: 
   - A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
   - A string consists of characters, which can be alphanumeric or not.
   - We need to check if a given string `s` is a palindrome under these conditions.

2. **Reasoning from the Fundamental Truths**: 
   - We can start by comparing the first character to the last, the second to the second last, and so on, disregarding non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring case.
   - If we find a mismatch, the string is not a palindrome.
   - Continue until you reach the middle of the string. If no mismatches are found, it's a palindrome.

### Brute Force Approach:

1. **Explanation of the Naive Solution**:
   - The naive approach is to create a new string that contains only the alphanumeric characters of the original string and convert them to lower case.
   - Then, we compare this new string with its reverse. If they are equal, it's a palindrome.

2. **Programming/Coding Principles**:
   - **Data Structure**: We could use a list to store the alphanumeric characters.
   - **Variables**: We would need at least one extra string or list to hold the alphanumeric characters.
   - **Loop**: A `for` loop to iterate through the original string.

3. **Python Code**:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
            cleaned_s = []
            for c in s:
                if c.isalnum():
                    cleaned_s.append(c.lower())
            return cleaned_s == cleaned_s[::-1]
    ```

4. **Analysis of Time and Space Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) to traverse the string and another O(n) to reverse it, which totals to O(2n) â‰ˆ O(n).
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the cleaned string.

### Optimized Approaches:

#### 1st Optimization:

1. **Intuition and Train of Thought**:
   - We can compare characters in-place without creating a new string.
   - We only need two pointers: one at the start (`l`) and one at the end (`r`). We move these pointers toward each other, skipping over any non-alphanumeric characters.

2. **Step-by-step Transition**:
   - Instead of creating a new string, we will directly work with the original string `s`.
   - We use `while` loops to find the next alphanumeric characters for each of the pointers.

3. **Programming/Coding Principles**:
   - **Data Structure**: No need for extra data structures.
   - **Variables**: Just two pointers (`l` and `r`).
   - **Loop**: `while` loop makes it easier to control the pointers dynamically.
   - **Base Case and Edge Cases**: When `l >= r`, we can stop the loop. For empty strings, the function should return `True`.

4. **Python Code**: As you already provided.

5. **Analysis of Time and Space Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for traversing the string once.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1) for using constant extra space.

### Strategies and Techniques:
1. **Two Pointers**: Useful for in-place comparisons in arrays/strings.
2. **Alphanumeric Check**: Useful for text manipulation problems.
3. **Ignoring Case**: `lower()` or `upper()` can standardize the characters for easier comparison.

### Mnemonics:
- **Two Pointers**: Think of them as two people walking towards each other but skipping obstacles (non-alphanumeric characters).
- **Alphanumeric Check**: Remember "A to Z" and "0 to 9" as the acceptable range.
- **Case Sensitivity**: "Lower the tone to make everyone equal"; remember to make all letters lower-case to make comparison straightforward.
