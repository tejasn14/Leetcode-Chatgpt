```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        minHeap = []
        for x, y in points:
            dist = (x ** 2) + (y ** 2)
            minHeap.append((dist, x, y))
        
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        res = []
        for _ in range(k):
            _, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res.append((x, y))
        return res
```

Alright, let's break down this problem.

## Problem Statement:

Given a list of points in a 2D plane, find the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

## First Principles:

1. **Distance Calculation**: The distance of a point `(x, y)` from the origin can be found using the Euclidean distance formula. However, since we are only comparing the distances, we can omit the square root to save computation, which means distance can be represented as `x^2 + y^2`.
  
2. **Priority of Elements**: We need to prioritize points based on their distance from the origin. This inherently suggests the use of a data structure like a heap that allows for efficient access and removal of the smallest element.

## Solving Intuition:

The core of this problem is sorting or prioritizing the points by their distance to the origin. A brute force approach might involve computing the distance for every point and then sorting the entire list, but this isn't the most efficient. Instead, a heap can be utilized to keep track of the closest points as they are processed.

### Time Complexity:

- **Looping through points**: O(n) where n is the number of points.
  
- **Inserting into the heap**: Each insert operation into a heap is O(log n), but since we do this n times, it's O(n log n).
  
- **Extracting k elements from the heap**: Each extraction is O(log n) and we do this k times, so it's O(k log n).

The dominating factor here is O(n log n) from the insertion.

### Space Complexity:

- **minHeap**: O(n) for all the points.

## Raw Algorithm:

1. Calculate the squared distance for each point from the origin.
2. Store these distances along with the points in a heap.
3. Extract the first `k` elements from this heap (they will be the `k` closest points).
4. Return these `k` points.

## Why The Code Is Written The Way It Is:

1. **Why the for loop?**: To iterate over each point and calculate its squared distance.
  
2. **Why the heap (minHeap)?**: Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. This property provides efficient access/removal of the smallest element in O(1) time. By placing all distances in a heap, we can efficiently find the `k` smallest distances.
  
3. **Why `heapify`?**: Python's heapq doesn't create a heap from an existing list in a bottom-up manner. The `heapify` function turns the list into a heap, in-place, in O(n) time.
  
4. **Why a tuple (dist, x, y)?**: The distance is placed first in the tuple because the heap will be organized based on the first element of the tuple, which in this case is the distance. The x and y coordinates are stored as well to be returned later.

## Base Cases and Edge Cases:

1. **Single Point**: If there's only one point, it's the closest.
  
2. **Number of Points less than k**: Return all the points.

3. **All Points are the same distance from the origin**: Any `k` points can be returned since they're equidistant.

## Optimizing Clues:

1. If you were to optimize further, consider the fact that sorting all points isn't necessary. You only need the `k` smallest elements, which suggests a modified quickselect algorithm might be more efficient, providing an average time complexity of O(n).

2. A max heap of size `k` can also be used. As you iterate through the points, calculate their distance and insert into the heap. If the heap size exceeds `k`, pop the maximum. This approach ensures you have the `k` smallest distances at the end.

## Mnemonics:

- **"Distance Dictates"**: Remember that the distance calculation is central to the solution.
  
- **"Heap Helps Prioritize"**: Heaps are your friend when it comes to prioritizing or sorting based on some criteria.

In essence, this problem tests your ability to efficiently prioritize or sort based on a specific criterion. Given its geometric nature, always start by figuring out how to calculate the relevant metric (in this case, distance) and then determine the most efficient way to prioritize based on that metric.
